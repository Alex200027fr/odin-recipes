    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pasta Bolognese is a classic Italian dish that combines al dente pasta with a rich and flavorful ground beef sauce, slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and tomatoes.</p>
        <p>The addition of milk helps tenderize the beef and adds a creamy richness to the sauce. The traditional combination of ground beef, pork, veal, and tomato, studded with salt-cured pancetta, creates a thick and savory sauce.</p>
